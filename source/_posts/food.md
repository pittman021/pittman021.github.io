i've begun the whole30 experiment to support my fiance. She just returned from a very long work trip overseas and felt she needed a hard 'reset'. Fair enough! So as good partner, I decided to join as well. 

though I'm not sold. here's [why](https://foodscienceinstitute.com/2016/08/13/whole30-diet-more-pseudoscience-and-quackery/).

1. it's not based on science
2. it's promotes an unhealthy relationship with food
3. it promotes atkins like meat consumption

However, it does do a few things right. It does prohibit sugar & alcohol. countless people are addicted or used to consuming sugar and refined grains. I'm no different. I tend to 'crave' beers and pizza toward the weekend - both a craving likely for sugars and a habitual trigger that I wouldn't mind removing.

There's no debate whether these are bad for you. In fact, cutting these out completely is probably a good idea. 

In my circle beer & wine flows with every activity it seems. Taking a month to reset from alcohol - similar to dry january - should be welcomed. Go easy on your friends 'drying up'. their abstinence is hard enough already. 

lastly, the diet promotes inviting challenge into your life. i encourage you to add challenges like these into your life. stop drinking coffee for a few days. no hot showers for a week. run every morning at 6am for a week. it can be whatever. get creative.

these challenges keep your perspective fresh and challenge your habits and triggers. for example, lately i  "need" something to drink at dinner aside from water. but probably until i was 25 i only ever drank water and didn't think twice of it. only after some months of including wine do i now feel its strange to just drink water. 

so try the whole30 or some other variation. just don't expect it to change your life long-term. only lifestyle change can do that.
